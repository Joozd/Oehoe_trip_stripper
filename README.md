# Oehoe Trip Stripper

This is a small tool built for **Oehoe** to remove duplicate trips from PDF exports.

The idea: certain trips may appear multiple times across different days. This tool analyzes the input file and filters out identical trips, keeping only one instance of each.

## WARNING ABOUT VULNERABILITY
This tool is vulnerable to an attack from specially created PDF files. **ONLY USE TRUSTED INPUT FILES**
